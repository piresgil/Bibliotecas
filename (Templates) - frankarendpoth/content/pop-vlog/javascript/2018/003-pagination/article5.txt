5. Your static site can greatly benefit from AJAX and the XMLHttpRequest. This paginator
relies entirely on XMLHttpRequest to communicate with the static file server. Luckily,
if you are building a static site and want dynamic content, a static file server
will allow you to use AJAX to request files. Any free hosting site will offer this
functionality, so you can use AJAX to create awesome tools like this paginator for
your static site. To further improve the functionality of your static website, you
can use things like service workers and Indexed DB to give your users a great experience.
