2. Pagination is used in many applications, perhaps without you even knowing it. If
you have used a search engine recently, you have used a web page employing pagination.
Search results are broken up into 10 to 20 items per page and at the bottom of that
page there is usually a small navigator bar that you can use to view the next set
of results if you wish to do so. Many paginators also allow the user to select a
specific page within several pages of the currently loaded content. Some paginators
allow the user to input a specific page manually with the keyboard. Another common
feature of pagination is to allow the user to specify how many results are loaded
per page.
