4. If you are planning to build a static website and want a simple paginator
to help your users view photos or links, this paginator will work well. Keep in
mind that it requires far more maintenance than a dynamic server. You will have
to update the list of files to cycle through anytime you add new content you want
to paginate to your website. If you are building a website that gets frequent updates, you
should seriously consider a hosting service that supports NodeJS. NodeJS is an easy
to learn and use backend scripting language that writes like JavaScript. Of course
there are many great server languages to choose from, but NodeJS is a natural fit
for front end developers who want to write a simple server with minimal overhead.
