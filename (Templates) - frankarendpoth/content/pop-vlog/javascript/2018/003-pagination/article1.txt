1. Pagination is a verb. To paginate content one must break that content into smaller
groups. For instance, if I had a database with 1,000 items in it and wanted to display
them to clients via a web page, I could make viewing the items more manageable by
breaking up the 1,000 items into groups of 10, 20, 50 or even 100. The
practice of breaking large chunks of data into smaller, more manageable groups for
viewing is known as pagination.
