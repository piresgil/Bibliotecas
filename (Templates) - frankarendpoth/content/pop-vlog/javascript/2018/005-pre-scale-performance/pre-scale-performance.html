    <p>This application compares the rendering speed of three drawing methods: scale,
      pre-scale, and pre-scaled-sheet. Scale draws graphics from the source image
      to a buffer, which is then scaled and drawn to the screen. Pre-scale creates
      individual scaled canvas elements for each sprite in the source image and then
      draws them directly to the screen. Pre-scaled-sheet draws the source image to
      a larger canvas element, and then those scaled graphics are drawn directly to
      the screen.</p>
