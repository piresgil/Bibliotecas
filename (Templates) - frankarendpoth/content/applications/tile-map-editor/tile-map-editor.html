    <h1>Weak Tile Map Editor v1/2</h1>
    <p>Right now this tile map editor only does one thing: It takes your comma separated list of tile values and shifts each value by the specified amount. What's that you say? "Pretty lame?" Well, yes it is. I suggest using the <a href = "http://www.mapeditor.org/">"Tiled Map Editor"</a>. It can do everything except what this program does, which is why I made this program.</p>

    <input id = "text_in"   type = "text"   value = "Tile Map Values Go Here!">
    <input id = "number_in" type = "number" value = "0">
    <input id = "button"    type = "button" value = "shift!">
    <output id = "text_out" type = "text" value = "Results Go Here"></output>

    <script src = "tile-map-editor.js" type = "text/javascript"></script>

  </body>
