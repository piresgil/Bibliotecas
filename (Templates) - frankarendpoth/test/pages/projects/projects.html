  <h1>Projects!</h1>
  <p>Keep in mind, these are just projects. They are not finished products, but mostly just stuff I am working on that looked cool enough to upload at the time. The code is not optimised at all, but the concepts are cool.</p>

  <br>

  <h1>Have Some JavaScript Projects!</h1>

  <p>These links open the projects directly in your browser.</p>

  <br>

  <p><a onclick = "window.location = 'pages/projects/content/2019-02-xx-noise/noise.html'">Noise Topography</a> - Generates 1D value noise as well as a 2D value noise infinite terrain. Performance can be greatly improved.</p>

  <br>

  <p><a onclick = "window.location = 'pages/projects/content/2019-02-xx-simplex-noise/simplex-noise.html'">Simplex Noise</a> - Generates 1D and 2D simplex noise, which is much smoother than value noise. Again, I threw this together quickly and it can be improved.</p>

  <br>

  <p><a onclick = "window.location = 'pages/projects/content/2019-02-xx-isometric-tile/main.html'">Isometric Tile</a> - Super cool pseudo 3D tile plotter that will crash your PC if it isn't lightning fast.</p>

  <br>

  <p><a onclick = "window.location = 'pages/projects/content/2019-03-04-orthographic-3d/orthographic-3d.html'">Orthographic 3D</a> - An orthographic 3D engine written completely from scratch in JavaScript, running without WebGL or any other libraries. It does not use a Z buffer, so there is a little bit of z fighting between surfaces. This is not meant for use in production.</p>

  <br>

  <p><a onclick = "window.location = 'pages/projects/content/2019-04-18-rasterizer/rasterizer.html'">Rasterizer</a> - A Pure JS rasterizer. It plots points in 2D shapes. Essentially it is a graphics drawing API that gives you access to each and every pixel in a shape before it is drawn. This is the basis for z buffering.</p>

  <br>

  <h1>Have Some PowerShell Projects!</h1>

  <p>These links will download Powershell Scripts to your computer.</p>

  <br>

  <p><a href = "pages/projects/content/2019-04-16-stay-awake/stay-awake.ps1" download>Stay Awake</a> - A PS script that enters a keystroke every several seconds to keep your computer from entering sleep mode.</p>

  <br>

  <p><a href = "pages/projects/content/2019-04-18-idle-alert/idle-alert.ps1" download>Idle Alert</a> - A PS script that will cause a terminal window to flash red and white if there is no mouse activity for over 10 minutes, reminding you to move the mouse before your screen falls asleep.</p>
